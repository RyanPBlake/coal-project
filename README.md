# coal-project
This project is focused on the Coal output of the United Kingdom.

There is a CSV file with the relevant data which the python and javascript files pull from.

The python file explores how the coal output of the UK has changed over time, how it can be moddeled and how various machine learning algorithms can be used to optimise the model.

The javascript is a WIP script which should function the same as the python file but as the back end of a HTML wep page.
